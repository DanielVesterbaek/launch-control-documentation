Main Features:
The Main Features part is split into 3 segments: "1. Select Vehicle, 2. Select Animation and 3. Select Physics" or "Rigging, Animation and Physics". Let's go over each of those here.


Rigging:
The rigging in LC uses Tags or Keywords to detect objects that are needed for rigging the car. If the hierarchy/naming of a model is supported, the rigging can be done with one click (For instance, Transporter Add-on cars have a supported hierarchy and the included example files). Custom tags can be selected in the "Manual Gearbox" to make the add-on work well with your own naming-convention.
