Animating Cars should be Fun! 
===================================

Launch Control (LC) is a developing Tool for Blender built to solve a lot of the problems we face when rigging and animating 4-wheeled cars in 3D.

The rig generated by the tool is fully supported in vanilla Blender. The add-on is just an interface that speeds up the workflow and gives you nice presets to get set up fast. 

The add-on comes packed with three example files. They serve as object hierarchy and naming guidelines for rigging and they also give you some high-quality meshes to play around with right off the bat. 

The add-on is split into two main UI parts: the "Main Features" and the "Manual Gearbox". The "Main Features" is the place you would spend the majority of the time rigging, animating, and simulating, while the "Manual Gearbox" holds all the add-on "tuning" options and extra features.
