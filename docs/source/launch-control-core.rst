Launch Control Core
===================================
The Main Features part is split into 3 segments: "Rigging, Animation, and Physics".
Let's go over each of those here.

|
.. _rigging:
One-Click Rigging
------
LC uses :ref:`rigging-tags` to detect the parts of the vehicle. If the naming convention of the 3D model is supported by LC, the rigging can be done with one click. 

:ref:`quick-tag-tool` can be used to prepare unsupported 3D models to work with LC with a few clicks.

:ref:`custom-tags` can be used to optimize LC for your own naming convention.

|
.. _vehicle-collection:
Vehicle Collection
^^^^^^^^^^

The Vehicle Collection field allows a multi-car workflow in LC and keeps track of the Active Car.

Select a Collection, which holds the vehicle you want to rig by dragging the collection from the outliner into the field or by browsing the available options by clicking the field

    *Selecting a Vehicle Collection* 

.. warning::
    Rigging vehicles across Blender Scenes is not supported. Please only use 1 scene for rigged Launch Control Vehicles in each file.

.. note::
    Avoid Copy/Pasting, Appending or Linking Vehicles that are rigged using Launch Control. If you want to move a vehicle to a new file, unrig the vehicle and rig it again in the destination file.

|
.. _rigging-tags:
Rigging Tags
^^^^^^^^^^


If all required car parts are found, LC can rig the car.

Required car parts:
    * *Car Body*
    * *Front Right Wheel*
    * *Front Left Wheel*
    * *Rear Right Wheel*
    * *Rear Left Wheel*


If any of the optional car parts are found they will be rigged - If not, they will be ignored. This behavior can be changed inside "User Preferences -> :ref:`rigging-preferences`"

Optional car parts:
    * *Front Right Brake Caliper*
    * *Front Left Brake Caliper*
    * *Rear Right Brake Caliper*
    * *Rear Left Brake Caliper*
    * *Right Headlight*
    * *Left Headlight*


The full list of accepted object names:

    * *Body:   ["Body", "Hull"]*
    * *Brake:   ["Brake","Brakes", "Calliper", "Caliper", "Callipers", "Calipers", "Bremse"]*
    * *Headlight:   ["Headlight", "Headlamp", "Headbulb", "Front_light", "Front_lamp", "Front_bulb", "Front_emitter"]*


The full list of accepted locations names:
    * *Rear, Left:   ["RL", "BL", "RearLeft", "BkL", "Bk.L", "Bk_L"]*
    * *Rear, Right:   [RR", "BR", "RearRight", "BkR", "Bk.R", "Bk_R"]*
    * *Front, Right:   ["FR", "FrontRight", "FtR", "Ft.R", "Ft_R"]*
    * *Front, Left:   ["FL", "FrontLeft", "FtL", "Ft.L", "Ft_L"]*

.. note::
   All Tags are case-insensitive.


|
.. _quick-tag-tool:
Quick-Tag Tool
^^^^^^^^^^
You can quickly tag Car Parts that needs renaming to be compatible with LC using the Quick-Tag Tool. Select a Car Part (for instance the Car Body) in the viewport, and hit, "body", to tag the selected object as the body of your car. Do the same for wheels and the brake calipers and headlights if desired. 

"FL, FR, RL and RR" referes to the location of the car part and respectively means: "Front Left, Front Right, Rear Left and Rear Right".

|
.. _native_lc_support:
Asset Packs for LC
^^^^^^^^^^
Many Vehicle models have supported naming conventions out of the box.
Some Asset Packs that are natively supported are:
    * `Car Transportation <https://blendermarket.com/products/transportation>`_
    * `Car Teleporter <https://blendermarket.com/products/car-teleporter>`_
    * `Traffiq Car <https://blendermarket.com/products/car-library-traffiq-vehicles-for-blender>`_


|
.. _library-override:
Linked Vehicles with Library Override
^^^^^^^^^^

In Launch Control, you can rigged a vehicle linked from another file. To do so, add a Library Override to all the objects you have added :ref:`rigging-tags` to and hit "Rig Vehicle!"


|
.. _troubleshoot_rigging:
Troubleshoot Rigging
^^^^^^^^^^

If any issues were found during rigging, LC will promt you with a message about which body part was missing.
The objects tagged as "Wheels" need to be the tire meshes of the vehicle. The objects tagged as "Body" and "Brakes" can be empties.

In some cases, the rigging is succesful, but inacurate, which can cause shaking or wobbly wheels.
This is usually due to one of 3 things:
    * The Rear or Front wheels are not properly alligned
    * Any of the wheels had a rotation offset or the geometry was not straightned before rigging
    * The Tire Mesh does not have evenly distributed geometry (See :ref:`force-pivot`)

.. note::
    Custom rigging and parenting can be done using the :ref:`rig-setup-mode`


|
.. _animation
Animation
------
LC uses a curve based animation workflow to give you full creative control over the movement. :ref:`user-animation` is acting on top of the automatically calculated animations, allowing the user full customization of the animation.

|
.. _driving-path:
Driving Path
^^^^^^^^

The curve which the vehicle is following is called "Driving Path". It can be modified by selecting it and going into "Edit Mode". In Edit mode you can also use the "Draw" or "Curve Pen" to alter the Driving Path.

|
.. _animation-presets:
Animation Presets
^^^^^^
To quickly try out animations use the presets. Select a Preset from the Gallery and hit "Animate Vehicle".

|
.. _user-path:
User Path
^^^^^^
To use your own "Bezier Curve" or "Nurbs Path" to animate the car along, use the "User Path" field.
Click the field to browse for your desired path or drag-n-drop the path into the field. Hit "Animate Vehicle".

The Vehicle will automatically be animated to drive along the length of the path over the scene time.

.. note::
    If a "User Path" is selected, it will overrule/gray out the animation presets.

.. _update-driving-path:
Update Driving Path
^^^^^^
While adjusting the control points of the :ref:`driving-path`, the total length of the path might change.
When this happens, LC will prompt you to "Update Driving Path" before adjusting any animation.
Click "Update Driving Path" in the LC interface. - This resolved any offsets to the animation due to the changed :ref:`driving-path`.

    *Update Driving Path Message in 3D View* 

|
.. _user-animation:
User Animation
^^^^^^
Much of the movement is calculated automatically by LC as the vehicle is following the path - This includes: Steering, Wheel Rotation, Suspension, Camber/Castor.
User Animation is what the user needs to animate to make the vehicle move like desired. Handles in the viewport are used to animate this.

..  figure:: img/IMG_UserAnim.png
    :alt: User Animation
    :class: with-shadow
    :width: 350px
    :align: center
    
    *Handles for User Animation* 

Go into "Pose Mode" to adjust any of the Handles.
After adjusting a Handle hit "I" on the keyboard and pick "Location" or "Rotation" depending on which Handle you are animating.

Movement Handle: Rotation
Mass Handle: Location
Drift Handle: Rotation

.. note::
    Animating the movement/speed of the Vehicle can easily be done with a Graph Editor open. The inclination of the animation curve at any point determines the speed at the given time.

..  figure:: img/IMG_speed.png
    :alt: Speed Animation

    :align: center
    
    *The Inclination determines the Speed* 

|
.. _ground-detection:
Ground Detection
^^^^^^

The vehicle will automatically detect any ground objects which are added to the collection called "Ground Detection".
To add additional objects which will act as ground detection move them into this collection.

Using the :ref:`snap-driving-path` you can make the control points of the :ref:`driving-path` snap to the ground detection objects if they are within 4 m range. 

.. note::
    The threshold for the vehicle detecting the ground is 4 m. If the vehicle is further away than this, it will instead stick to the path.


|
.. _speedometer:
Speedometer
^^^^^^

Checking this box will show a Speedometer hovering over the vehicle in the 3D view. A Speedometer will also be shown in the Add-on UI.

The Units can be changed inside the :ref:`user-preferences`.

.. note::
    The Speed is calculated temporally and can only be calculated correctly when the animation is playing forward in real-time. Use the "Refresh Speed" Button to force LC to calculate the correct speed at the current frame.

.. note::
    The Speedometer in the Add-on UI is only working when the mouse is hovering over the panel. Otherwise this value does not update due to the way Blender works. The Speedometer in the 3D view is not affected by this.


|
.. _real-time-physics:
Real-Time Physics
------

Physics are used in LC to add secondary motion to the vehicle, which is tedious to animate by hand.
The Physics are layed on top of the Automatic and User Animation and are fully non-destructive to the User Animation.

Presets can be used to get different results, or use the :ref:`physics-customize` checkbox to adjust the Physics settings in detail.

The Physics always has one of five states:
    * :ref:`live-physics`
    * :ref:`baked-physics`
    * :ref:`muted-physics`
    * :ref:`outdated-physics`
    * :ref:`invalid-physics`

.. note::
    The Physics are framerate independent, but are optimized a framerate of 24 fps.

|
.. _live-physics:
Live Physics
^^^^^^

When the Physics are LIVE, they are simulated in real-time when Blender is playing forward.

..  image:: img/IMG_LivePhysics.jpg
    :alt: Enable Physics
    :class: with-shadow
    :width: 300px
    :align: center

|

.. note::
    Physics cannot be calculated LIVE when playing backward.
    LIVE Physics will cache when playing forward. To ensure you are seeing the latest result, revert the timeline back to frame 0 or hit the 'Reset Physics'-button.

|
.. _baked-physics:
Baked Physics
^^^^^^

When the Physics are BAKED, changes to the animation will not affect the physics. The Physics are locked and are ready to be rendered.

..  image:: img/IMG_BakedPhysics.jpg
    :alt: Enable Physics
    :class: with-shadow
    :width: 300px
    :align: center

|

.. warning::
    Due to a bug in Blender, BAKED physics do not load correctly when re-opening the file. After reopening, you would need to bake the physics again.

To bake the physics, click "Bake Physics!". This will take you to the baking menu, where you can add :ref:`physics-warm-up` and start the bake with "Confirm Bake!".
LC will mark the area which will be baked in the timeline.

    :align: center
    
    *When bake finishes, you can revert back to the main Physics Menu* 


|
.. _physics-warm-up:
Warm Up Frames
******

To avoid "popping" on the first frame of the physics you can add warm up frames before your animated section starts. During the baking process you have the option of enabling this and setting the amount of frames.

.. note::
    It's only possible to add warm up frames if your animation starts after frame 0 of the scene timeline. Warm up frames can not be negative frames.

|
.. _muted-physics:
Muted Physics
^^^^^^

When the Physics are MUTED, the baked physics motion is kept, but disabled temporarily. The vehicle will only have the motion from the animation. Hit the Unmute button to show the baked physics motion again.

|
.. _outdated-physics:
Outdated Physics
^^^^^^

When the Physics are OUTDATED, they have been baked, but changes in the scene or the physics settings have made the bake invalid or outdated. Please bake the physics again if this is the case.

|
.. _invalid-physics:
Invalid Physics
^^^^^^

When the Physics are INVALID, you will need to hit the "Reset Physics" button to the right in the. If the Physics are BAKED, this will launch a re-bake, but if the Physics are LIVE, it will instead just clear the real-time cache, resolving the issue.

|
|
|

.. _g-force-vizualiser:
G-Force Vizualiser
^^^^^^

To make it easier to debug what the Physics are doing a G-Force Vizualiser is showing up above the vehicle. It can be disabled inside :ref:`view` in the "Manual Gearbox".
When the G-Force exceeds 1.8 g, the vizualiser turns red indicating that a big force is acting on the body. To decrease the magnitude of the force, decrease the acceleration of the vehicle or make turns smoother.

    *The G-Forces which are working on the vehicle*

.. note::
    LC does not have a physically correct simulation engine behind it so take the values with a grain of salt. It does however indicate the approximate value for you.


|
.. _physics-customize:
Customize
^^^^^^

By checking to "Customize" box, a list of sliders will be revealed.
These sliders can be used to adjust the parameters used when simulating the physics. If the Physics are Baked, you would need to re-bake to see the result of the change. 

..  figure:: img/IMG_PhysicsCustom.jpg
    :alt: Custom Physics
    :class: with-shadow
    :width: 350px
    :align: center
    
    *Physics can be customized in the Interface* 

**Spring Hardness:**
    * *The 'Tightness/Hardness' of the Spring. Increase this to have the Spring be harder and respond faster (Feeling of a light vehicle or road/track vehicle), decrease this to make the Spring respond slower and feel softer (Feeling of a heavy offroad vehicle).*

**Spring Damping:**
    * *How quickly the spring stops moving after an impact. A low value makes the spring wobble for a long time after an impulse.*

**Smoothing:**
    * *Adds extra smoothing to the ride. Makes the response slower and dampens more of the forces. Equivilant to Decreasing 'Hardness' and Increasing 'Dampening' at the same time.*

**Simulate Gravity:**
    * *Let the physics take care of the Gravity when the vehicle is in the air. When 'ON' the vehicle might deviate more from the Driving Path during jumps. When 'OFF' the car will stick 'tightly' to the path, even if it would be physically impossible - This is useful for making the car do loops or running over a bumpy road in a controlled manner*

**Auto Level:**
    * *During airtime, the vehicle can start to nose-dive or pitch backwards. Using Auto Level, you can bias the physics toward keeping the vehicle level rather than pitching or rolling.*

**Vehicle Mass:**
    * *Similar to 'Spring Hardness', affects how much the car is affected by impacts from the road. Increase this to make the bumps and landings have less impact on the body motion of the vehicle and vice-versa.*

**Spring Offset:**
    * *Fine-tune the physics Suspension Height. This is only affecting the car when physics are turned on.*

.. warning::
    When "Spring Offset" is set too high, the car will keep bouncing. 




|
.. _postfx:
PostFX
^^^^^^

To make it easier to art direct the Physics, use the PostFX to adjust the influence of the Physics on each Axis of Rotation and Location. PostFX can be animated as well.

Body Forces:

    Pitch, Yaw, Roll:
        * *The physics influence on the body of the car in each of the 3 rotation axis.*

    Up/Down: 
        * *The physics influence on the up/down movement of the body of the car.*
|
Wheel Forces:

    Up/Down:
        * *How much an impact from the ground affects the wheels up/down movement. (During jumps or when running over bumps)*
       
    Tire Pressure:
        * *How much the tires are allowed to clip through the floor (To simulate low pressure inside the tires when they have a hard impact with the ground).*
