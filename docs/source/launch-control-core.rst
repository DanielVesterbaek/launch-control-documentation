Launch Control Core
===================================
The Main Features part is split into 3 segments: "Rigging, Animation, and Physics".
Let's go over each of those here.

LC uses :ref:`rigging-tags` to detect the parts of the vehicle. If the naming convention of the parts are supported by LC, the rigging can be done with one click. :ref:`custom-tags` can be used to optimize LC for your own naming convention.
